# neptunia_rebirth1.bms
QuickBMS script for the Neptunia Re;Birth trilogy of games
Also works with "Superdimension Neptune VS Sega Hard Girls" - same engine as the trilogy uses.

Not mine btw. This is mostly for archival, as the website that originally hosted this has been shut down.
No context will be provided here - figure out yourself what this script may be used for.
