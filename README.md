# neptunia_rebirth1.bms
QuickBMS script for the Neptunia Re;Birth trilogy of games.

Also works with "Superdimension Neptune VS Sega Hard Girls" - same engine as the trilogy uses.

Not mine btw. This is mostly for archival purposes, in case the host site shuts down.
No context will be provided here - figure out yourself what this script may be used for.
